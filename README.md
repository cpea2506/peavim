# Introduction
This is my configuration for Neovim. Feel free to check it out!

 ## Installation
- Clone this repo into your `nvim` folder.
- You may need to install [packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) first.
- In your terminal: `nvim +PackerInstall`. Maybe some errors would occur. But don't worry, just `Enter` until an installation popup appear.
- Exit Neovim and enter again. Enjoy your new look!

## Note

I'm learning how to make this automatically install into your nvim folder, so you won't see any error in the future.
