## Introduction
This is my configuration for Neovim. Feel free to check it out!

 ## Installation
To get started, first you need to install [packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim). Then clone this repo into your `nvim` folder.

> For Linux and Unix 

```zsh
git clone git@github.com:cpea2506/peavim.git ~/.config/nvim && cd ~/.config/nvim
```

After that, in your terminal: 

```zsh
nvim +PackerInstall
```

Maybe some errors would occur. But don't worry, just press `Return` until an installation popup appears.

Exit Neovim and enter again. Enjoy your new look!

## Note

I'm learning how to make this automatically install into your nvim folder, so you won't see any error in the future.
