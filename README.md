 ## Installation
- Clone this repo into your `nvim` folder.
- You may need to install [packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) first.
- In your terminal: `nvim +PackerInstall`. Maybe it some errors would occur. But don't worry, just `Enter` until an installation popup appear.
- Exit and enter `nvim` again. Enjoy your new look!

## Note
I'm learning how to make this automatically install into your nvim folder, so you won't see any error in the future.
